This repo started out as an exploratory exercise to help me familiarize myself with the latest CloureScript libraries and JavaScript tooling, namely:

- [<b>U</b>Ix CLJS React Wrapper](https://github.com/pitch-io/uix)
- [<b>T</b>ailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [<b>S</b>hadow CLJS](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
- [<b>B</b>unJS](https://bun.sh)

The end result is a starter that creates a React SPA with excellent Shadow and Tailwind hot-reloading and production builds (7KB CSS, ~100KB JS) all orchestrated by Bun.

## Getting started

3 steps to get up and running:

1. Install Bun if you haven't already: https://bun.sh/docs/installation.
2. Install all dependencies: `bun i`.
3. Start the starter: `bun dev`.

The app will launch on http://localhost:3000.

## Creating a production build

1 step to create an optimized build using :advanced compilation and Tailwind JIT: `bun prod`.

This will export the app to `/prod`. You can view it via serve: `bunx serve prod`.
